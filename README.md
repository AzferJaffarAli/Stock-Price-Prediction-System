Title: Stock Price Prediction System using LSTM

Description:
The Stock Price Prediction System using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a project designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The system utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks like time series forecasting.

The project involves the following key components and concepts:

1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock price data for the target stock(s) is collected from reliable sources such as financial databases or APIs. The dataset typically includes features such as date, opening price, closing price, high and low prices, trading volume, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is preprocessed to prepare it for training the LSTM model. This may involve tasks such as handling missing values, normalization/scaling of features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Building**: An LSTM neural network model is constructed using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model is trained using the historical stock price data to learn patterns and relationships between input features (e.g., past stock prices) and the target variable (e.g., future stock prices).

4. **Training**: The LSTM model is trained using the prepared training dataset. During training, the model adjusts its internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the prediction error.

5. **Evaluation**: The trained model's performance is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.

6. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on unseen data. The system takes input features (e.g., past stock prices) and generates predictions for future stock prices.

7. **Visualization**: The predicted stock prices can be visualized using plotting libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to analyze the model's performance and compare it with actual stock prices.

8. **Deployment**: The trained model can be deployed as a web application, API, or standalone software for users to interact with and make predictions for desired stocks.

Overall, the Stock Price Prediction System using LSTM aims to provide investors, traders, and financial analysts with a tool to make informed decisions by forecasting future stock prices based on historical data and machine learning techniques.
